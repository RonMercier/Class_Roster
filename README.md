Roster Management Program written in C++ that demonstrates the use of classes, inheritance, polymorphism, pointers, and general flow control.  This application is built around parsing and manipulating data from an input string, and storing them in objects.  There are two classes in the project.

### Student class
    Defines Student objects
    Stores variable data
    Functions that return data, as well as modify data
    

### Roster class
    Parses data from a string
    Creates an array of pointers to student objects
    Modifies data in the student objects
    Ability to make calculations using student object's data members and output results
    
The main function demonstrates the program's ability to use its functions, and outputs data in a legible format.
